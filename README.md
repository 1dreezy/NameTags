### 🏷️ Nametags Script for SA-MP (MoonLoader)
Enhance your SA-MP experience with custom nametags, health, armor indicators, and AFK status. Built using Lua for MoonLoader, this script provides a clean and customizable display for player information.  

## 📋 Features
This mod was created as an alternative to the default name tags in GTA San Andreas, which feel outdated compared to modern standards.  
I added PNG icons for **Armor**, **Health**, and **AFK Time**, while still keeping a natural look that fits the game’s original style.  

The mod also includes a settings dialog where you can customize:  
- Font type  
- With/without outline  
- Colored or standard display  

The project is in its final state, since I stopped modding GTA San Andreas and ran out of ideas for new additions.  

This mod is stable – it does not cause crashes and no bugs have been found during testing.  

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Download the script and place it in your `moonloader` folder.  
2. Make sure to have the resources in `moonloader/resources/visualtags/`.  
3. Enjoy.
